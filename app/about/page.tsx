              I am a self-taught Frontend Web Developer from India. About three
              years ago is when I started my learning journey on how to make the
              web stunning and responsive. I have always been a curious
              individual, which is why I’d love to collaborate and do some
              real-world projects in order to flourish my skills.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              My journey began with a strong curiosity about how the web works,
              and this curiosity grew into a love for coding. Over the years, I
              have honed my skills in JavaScript, React, Next.js, CSS, and other
              modern web technologies. I believe in writing clean, maintainable
              code and continuously improving my development process.
              {/* I'm not perfect, however. I'm very far from perfection, yet I'm
            resilient, assertive and stubborn, and I find learning a fascinating
            process. I am currently learning about PWAs and my future plan is to
            learn about ML for Web Performance. */}
